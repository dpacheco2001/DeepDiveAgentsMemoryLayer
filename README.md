# Deep Dive: Agents Memory Layer

## Overview
This research repository is dedicated to exploring and understanding the memory layer capabilities in AI agents. It focuses on investigating effective memory management techniques, analyzing how agent behavior can be modified through persistent memories, and developing advanced memory architectures for more contextually aware AI systems.

## Research Focus Areas
- Memory persistence and retrieval strategies in conversational agents
- Dynamic behavior adaptation based on accumulated memories
- Effective memory encoding and representation techniques
- Long-term vs. short-term memory management
- Memory contextualization and relevance assessment
- Memory-augmented reasoning and decision making

## Technologies
This research primarily leverages:
- [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph): For building structured, stateful multi-agent systems
- [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain): Core framework for language model applications
